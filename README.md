[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/nrkno/tv-automation-state-timeline-resolver.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/nrkno/tv-automation-state-quantel-gateway)

This is a part of the [**Sofie** TV News Studio Automation System](https://github.com/nrkno/Sofie-TV-automation/).

## Abstract
This library uses native bindings to bridge the Quantel ISA System CORBA API and a Sofie-specific HTTP REST API, allowing discovery of clips and playback control of Quantel servers.

## Supported devices
* [Grass Valley sQ series media servers](https://www.grassvalley.com/products/sq_1000_servers/) via ISA System.

## Dev install instructions

TBD. Note that in its current form, this library will only build on Windows and targets Win32 (`ia32`) architecture. A 32-bit version of node is required to run it.
